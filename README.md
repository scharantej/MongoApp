## Analyzing the Problem: Learn more about Mongolia

The problem statement is to create a Flask application that provides information about Mongolia. To design this application, we need to identify key aspects:

1. **Data**: What information do we need to present about Mongolia? This includes historical, geographical, cultural, and economical data.


2. **User Interaction**: How will users interact with the application? This includes browsing different sections or pages for information, searching for specific information, or potentially providing feedback.


3. **Content Structure**: How will the information be organized within the application? Sections, categories, or even a search function can be used for this.

## Flask Application Design

The Flask application will consist of the following components:

1. **HTML Files**:

   - `index.html`: The main landing page of the application. It will provide a brief introduction to Mongolia and a menu of options for users to explore different aspects.
   
   - `history.html`: A page dedicated to Mongolia's history, including key events, historical figures, and important eras.

   - `geography.html`: A page covering Mongolia's geographical features, like its climate, major cities, and notable landmarks.

   - `culture.html`: A page showcasing Mongolian culture, including traditional music, dance, cuisine, and festivals.

   - `economy.html`: A page discussing Mongolia's economy, focusing on major industries, natural resources, and economic indicators.

   - `contact.html`: A contact form for users to send feedback or inquiries.


2. **Routes**:

   - `/`: The home route, which displays the `index.html` page.

   - `/history`: This route displays the `history.html` page, providing information about Mongolia's history.

   - `/geography`: This route displays the `geography.html` page, providing information about Mongolia's geographical features.

   - `/culture`: This route displays the `culture.html` page, providing information about Mongolian culture.

   - `/economy`: This route displays the `economy.html` page, providing information about Mongolia's economy.

   - `/contact`: This route displays the `contact.html` page, allowing users to send feedback or inquiries.
